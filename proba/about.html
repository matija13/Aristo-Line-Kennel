<section id="sadrzaj">
<article class="region">
	<p>Aristo Line Kennel was founded in 2017., and is registered in Serbian Kennel Club - KSS and FCI under number 6623 .
		In our kennel we breed mostly dwarf harlequin and silver poodles.
		We don't have many dogs and litters (one to two litters per year), because we are looking for quality, not quantity.<br/>
		From very young age I was surrounded by all kinds of animals and my first dog was English Cocker Spaniel.
		When he passed away for few years our family was without a pet dog. 
		In 2013, we took the first poodle , and we fell in love with the breed.The first poodle was dwarf harlequin poodle from Jasna Okljesa Drazic's litter,and his name is HARLEQUIN STAR JO-JO ( Jo-Jo ).</article>

<article class="region"><p>I was not interested in showing and breeding at the time, so he was a pet for a few years.Then, in 2016, I decided to get him a friend, so Jessie was introduced to our familly . 
I started to show interestet in showing.
	Soon, she became a Champion and a Grand Cahmpion of Serbia , and that give me a push to start this type of hoby.<br/> 
	Later, I started to show Jo-Jo and, in just a year and a half of showing,
	he became a Champion of Serbia, Bosina and Hercegovina, Repubilika Srpska, Hungary , Grand Champion of Serbia , World Winner 2019 ( OTK ) , Multi BIS and Club Winner, 
	and one of the most awarded harlequin poodles of all sizes in Europe.
	In winter of 2017. came Leo, then in late 2018. Glasha arrived. Rina is the newest member of family and we are looking forward to her future shows.</p><br/>
